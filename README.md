# Circular Dichroism and Optical Rotatory Dispersion Kramers Kronig numerical transformation
A python script that performs a numerical Kramers-Kronig transformation from Circular Dichroism into Optical Rotatory Dispersion. A "leap frog" method is used for the numerical integration. The script outputs a plot .png file. The data used is from a Lorentzian function, but raw data can be used as well.


# Kramers-Kronig numerical integration
The Kramers-Kronig relation can be used relate two physical quantities to each other and in this script it was used to calculate Optical Rotatory Dispersion from a simulated Circular Dichroism measurement.

The relation is expressed with the equations [1]

and they can be expressed numerically with the equations

To avoid a situation where there is a zero in the denominator of these equations, a "leap frog" method is used. For odd i we use even j, and for even i we use odd j. So when i is odd

and when i is even [2]

# Output
The script outputs the following plot, showing the original Lorentzian peak in blue, the initial transformation in orange and a twice transformed data in red. We can see that the transformation is qualitatively valid, as the original peak and ord-to-cd-to-ord data matches the original plot.
